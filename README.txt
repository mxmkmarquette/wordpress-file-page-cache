Advanced file based page cache with PHP Opcache boost option (500x faster than Redis and Memcached)

== Description ==

This plugin is a file based page cache with PHP Opcache boost option for [500x faster than Redis and Memcached](https://blog.graphiq.com/500x-faster-caching-than-redis-memcache-apc-in-php-hhvm-dcd26e8447ad) cache speed.

Due to the limit of the PHP Opcache total size, the boost option can be configured for individual pages.
